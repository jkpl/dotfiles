# dotfiles

Here's a bunch of my dotfiles. Some of them I've built myself but most of the
stuff is recycled from other people's files. Feel free to grab any part of
these configurations for your own use.

Here are a couple of highlights on what I have in my dotfiles.

## Awesome WM

The window manager I use these days.

- Some keymappings are similar to ones used in [dwm][].
- Volume control widget mostly ripped from [Vicious][].
- [Icon theme][icons] by anrxc.

## Emacs

I run Emacs 24 on most of my computers.

- Package management using package.el.
- Configurations for [Notmuch][] plugin.

## XKB

Includes my own XKB keymap (AltFin). It is based on the US International
keyboard layout. It just removes all the dead keys and adds some diaeresis
mappings to that extra key between the left shift and Z keys. The mapping is
similar one used in [ArkkuDvorak][].

## Other stuff I have configurations for

- [Bash][]
- [ZSH][]
- [Tmux][]
- [Readline][]
- Xresources
