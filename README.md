# dotfiles

Here's a bunch of my dotfiles. Some of them I've built myself and some of the
stuff is recycled from other people's files. Feel free to grab any part of
these configurations for your own use. Here are the stuff I have configurations
for:

- [Emacs][]
- [Bash][]
- [Tmux][]
- [Readline][]

[Emacs]: http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/
[Bash]: http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/
[Tmux]: http://tmux.sourceforge.net/
[Readline]: http://www.gnu.org/software/readline/
